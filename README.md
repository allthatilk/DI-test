# Development Initiatives Test

## Task

```
Using Python, write functionality that takes any ISO country code as input, and can return for the given country:
	* A list of Global Adaptation Index scores for all available years
	* The average of all Global Adaptation Index scores for all available years

There's no need to return the country text name (e.g. Andorra if the input country code was AD)
```
